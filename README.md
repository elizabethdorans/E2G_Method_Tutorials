# E2G Method Tutorials
This repo contains tutorials for linking enhancers (ATAC peaks) to genes using single-cell RNA + ATAC multiome data. Data preprocessing and peak-gene linking scripts are included for the following methods: Signac (Stuart 2021 Nature Methods), Cicero (Pliner 2018 Mol Cell), ArchR (Granja 2021 Nature Genetics), SCENT (Sakaue 2024 Nature Genetics) (pending).

See respective folders for code implementing each peak-gene linking method.
